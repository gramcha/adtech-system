#### Explanation of structure
- src/main/java/com/gramcha is standard package strucutre.
- src/main/java/com/gramcha is standard package strucutre.
    - entities - It contains the entity classes (schema) of delivery, click, and Install. These classes are represented Mongo documents and same is used in the Kafka data schema deserialization.
    - queryservice - It contains the spring boot application class and other sub packages given below.
    - config - It provides MongoTemplate class bean and Mongo connection factory bean.
    - controller - It has RestController class which exposes the required endpoints.
    - exception - It has Hateoas based global exception controller of this web service. All the unhandled exceptions are handled here and the corresponding format response will be returned.
    - repos - It has repository interfaces and implementation classes to get entities from Mongo DB.
     - service - It has two service classes for the following activities

    - resources - It has the application.yml file which has the details about Mongo DB, and server port details.
- test/main/java/com/gramcha/queryservice is standard package strucutre.
    - controller - It has a test class which will test the StatisticsController class with spring mockMVC.
    - repos - It has test classes to test the repository classes to validate the MongoDb Repos integration.
    - service - It has test classes to the core service class.
